# Pagination

Help users navigate forwards and backwards through a series of pages. For example, search results or guidance that’s divided into multiple website pages — like the GOV.UK mainstream guide format.

## When to use this component

Consider using pagination when:

- showing all the content on a single page makes the page take too long to load
- most users will only need the content on the first page or first few pages

## When not to use this component

Only break up content onto separate pages if it improves the performance or usability of your service.

Avoid using the ‘infinite scroll’ technique to automatically load content when the user approaches the bottom of the page. This causes problems for keyboard users.

Do not use this Pagination component for linear journeys — for example, where you’re asking the user to complete a form. Instead, use the Button component (usually a ‘Continue’ button) to let the user move to the next page — and a Back link to let them move to the previous page.
