### Error messages

<Canvas of={FileUploadStories.errorMessage} />

Make sure errors follow the guidance in [error message](?path=/docs/components-error-message--docs) and have specific error messages for specific error states.

Say ‘Select a [whatever they need to select]’.

For example, ‘Select a report’.
