# Warning text

<Canvas of={WarningTextStories.primary} />

## When to use this component

Use the warning text component when you need to warn users about something important, such as legal consequences of an action, or lack of action, that they might take.

## How it works

<Canvas of={WarningTextStories.primary} />

You might need to rewrite the hidden text (‘Warning’ in the example) to make it appropriate for your context.
