# Phase banner

Use the phase banner component to show users your service is still being worked on.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={PhaseBannerStories.primary} />
</Canvas>

## When to use this component

Services hosted on a service.gov.uk domain must use the phase banner until they pass a live assessment.

Use an alpha banner when your service is in alpha, and a beta banner if your service is in private or public beta.

## How it works

Your banner must be directly under the black GOV.UK header and colour bar.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={PhaseBannerStories.primary} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story of={PhaseBannerStories.beta} />
</Canvas>

## Add a feedback link

Use a ‘feedback’ link to collect on-page feedback about your service. This can open an email or take the user to a dedicated page or form. Whatever option you use, make sure that users do not lose their place in the service and can return to the page they were on.

Find out what [feedback you need to collect at each phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/measuring-user-satisfaction#user-satisfaction-through-each-service-phase) in the GOV.UK Service Manual.
